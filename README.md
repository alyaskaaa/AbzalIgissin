# Abzal Igissin, Analysis of Hotel booking demand

In this project I analyze demand of people of different categories to the booking of hotels.

The dataset is taken from the webpage Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

The following data was used for analysis: agent, company, hotels, age, days in waiting list and others.

The main library used for analysis is Pandas.
